This private project is based on the Hungarian mathematics workbook
"Összefoglaló feladatgyűjtemény matematikából" (literally: 
"Summary workbook for mathematics") in which the first 161 questions
are related to general concepts from high-school and undergraduate mathematics.

The project was inspired by my high-school math teacher who insisted
that every student of her must create a notebook containing every one of
the theorems, proof, etc. which we encounter during our studies, on the
appropriate numbered page in the notebook.

Currently I am uploading the main body of text (which has been already 
finished a few years ago) and meanwhile creating the necessary figures.
Also I am looking for a reviewer.

The project is currently only available in Hungarian. After it is finished
I will consider a translation.
